{\bf This project is an individual assignment and must be done
independently by each student. No late submissions will be
accepted for this project.}

\noindent

In this project, you will implement a Transport Layer protocol to transmit data
with Reliable Data Transfer from a client (Sender) to a server (Receiver) in
the presence of channel errors and loss.
The protocol to be implemented by you is the Go-Back-N protocol. The protocol
will be unidirectional in which data is sent in one direction only (client to
server) with acknowledgements being
sent in the reverse direction (server to client). Only positive ACKs are used.
The transmission of packets will be done over UDP
(that represents an unreliable network layer channel)
using fixed UDP ports.


\begin{verbatim}
    <----------------- 16 bits (2 bytes) ------------------>
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |              Count (no. of data bytes)               |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                Packet Sequence Number                |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |            Data Bytes      |          ...            |
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

The second field of the header is the
packet sequence number. Each
packet transmitted by the client is assigned
a sequence number in the range 0 through 15.
